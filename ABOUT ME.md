A highly skilled financial analyst with more than four years of
experience in analysis and economics, specializing in budgeting, cost
management, and forecasting. Favorite part of my work has always
been data processing and optimization.

I have recently been focusing on expanding my skillset, particularly in
the field of data science and analysis, by studying machine learning,
Python, and A/B testing. My experience, combined with my newfound
knowledge, is sure to be an asset to any company looking for a data
scientist or analyst.
